    Storage is a separate container for each file. You need to use Add Storage method before adding
    files to your projects via API. Files that should be uploaded into storage include files for
    localization, screenshots, Glossaries, and Translation Memories.

    Storage id is the identifier of the file uploaded to the Storage.

    Note: Storage is periodically cleared. The files that were already uploaded to your account will
    be removed from storage and will remain in your account.
